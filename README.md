# Communication Algebra

## Abstract
Your abstract.

## Introduction
In this document, we introduce the so-called **Communication Algebra**, a subalgebra of **Process Algebra**. Communication Algebra is an algebraic approach for modeling extreme concurrent systems.

The algebra is designed to be compatible with several dataflow functional programming languages, such as the **Cerebras Software Language (CSL)**. It includes at least four layers or domains:
- **PE (Processing Elements)**
- **Communication**
- **Task**
- **Data**

### Outline
1. We first provide an intuitive, empirical description of the **Dataflow Programming Model**, helping readers rediscover the algebra themselves.
2. We develop a process to generate **Consensus Algebra**, which serves as a shared intermediate language to facilitate collaboration within a group of programmers.
3. Finally, we present the body of the algebraic representation of the CSL program, including:
   - Definitions
   - Lemmas
   - Theorems
   - Example applications
